### 4. Modify the Configuration (Optional)

You can now modify the `config/portfolioConfig.tsx` file to update the following:

- **Personal Information**: Update your name, email, title, location, etc.
- **Social Links**: Replace the default URLs with your own GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.
- **About Section**: Add a personalized description of your background and career.
- **Skills & Tech Stack**: Modify the categories and skills to match your expertise.

### 5. Run the Development Server

After configuring the file, you can run the project locally to preview your portfolio:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server. You can view your portfolio by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

### 6. Build and Deploy

When you're satisfied with your portfolio, you can build it for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a production-ready version of the site in the `build` directory. From here, you can deploy it to platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

### 7. View My Live Portfolio

You can view My live portfolio at [tahmid37.github.io/ProBuilder/](https://tahmid37.github.io/ProBuilder/).
